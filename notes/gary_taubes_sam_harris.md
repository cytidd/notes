### Transcribed Notes
Insulin regulates glucose, but also instructs tissue to take up more fat. More insulin, more fat.

*Pillars of Nutritional "Science" (myths)*
1. Obesity is an energy balance disorder caused by taking in more calories than expenditure, rather than a hormonal disorder when the dis-regulation is caused by what foods you eat rather than how much.
 - WWII wrecked advances in nutritional science. They were on the path of hormonal causes, but after the war, non-scientists took over and ruined it. 
2. High fat causes heart disease. Endicrinology isn't even in the literature.  They aren't mentioning the hormones that regulate fat accumulation.
3. The idea that people should consume mostly plant diets.

Most nutritional science is bad science
- jump to conclusions
- 20x increase in risk? Go causal.
- 20%? Causal is danger zone.  Could be any number of things.

Thinking about food, or seeing a commercial, will cause insulin to enter the bloodstream.  Probably requires dwelling on it, imagining eating it - just the passing thought isn't enough.

Engineering problem: in order for insulin to its job, it needs to be in the blood before you eat.  So, insulin instructs lean tissue to take up blood sugar, and fat tissue to store calories as fat, which removes nutrients from circulation, which activates hunger.
- it's the whole point of the appetizer. Seeing a picture of the appetizer serves the same function.

Wow, I had no idea *insulin is responsible for fat uptake*.

So, Atkins got it right.

Medical community is human, doesn't want to be wrong.

On the science: a good experiment will have competing hypotheses that make different predictions.
