### Transcribed Notes

The question isn't about Trump - it's about _us_.

Can the constraints holding Trump even hold?

Americans underestimate how unlucky we can be, since we've been lucky a lot lately.

If Trump can be elected, what about somebody even more dangerous?

Americans have gotten into the habit of congratulating ourselves. If we believe ourselves exceptional, it's hard to see how we can improve.

History doesn't repeat, but it does show us what's possible.

Fascism and communism is a response to globalism.

If we think something is new, we don't look for patterns.

This is the 2nd globalization. The first one ended in WWI, and the Depression.

Globalization is the globalization of comparison. Not just limited to their neighbors, now it's global.  How am I doing in relation to that country over there?

Putting a face on globalization as "nefarious", alleviates the government of the responsibility of dealing with globalization pressures.

One of the first stages of regime change is people saying "democracy is fake". Trump + co spent a lot of time basically saying this. Easy for disenfranchised to think this.

Democracy is not automatic. 
- requires effort to maintain. Second Law of Thermodynamics

People are learning how far they can got to abuse "the other"

Authoritarians require consent.  At the beginning, people give consent.  The longer an authoritarian system is in place, the higher the cost of changing it.

If we do nothing, we are allowing the state to prevail

Editorial in WWII - Jews didn't think shit was going to happen.  

Spicer says things like Hitler didn't kill his own people, as if the Jews and the handicapped weren't his people.

Beware the one-party state.

Just because we've had democracy for a long time, doesn't mean we'll keep it.

We've been drifting away from democracy for awhile.

Trump posed as a friendly oligarch.  Rode in on "too much money in politics"

Gerrymandering has become surgical.

Freedom is usually given away "with cheers"

American think everything happens here and it flows out.

Russia's plan is to bring everyone down to their level.

People (some) see Russia as the proper model for Republicans

First foreign policy speech was written by someone on the Russian payroll.

Russia is publicly known to have influenced and meddled.

Collusion _cannot_ be ignored.

Hostility to facts

Authoritarians assault facts

Don't want an investigation? Why not?

To abandon fact, to abandon truth, is to abandon freedom.

Open hostility to verifiable facts.

Propaganda is the replacement of our natural apprehension of the facts with something more appealing.

Destroy democracy by destroying the press, the twist of facts

We're hostage to the news cycle

We're not really free unless we can put our thoughts on subjects, not just parroting what we see on TV
- stop watching.

When people fail to point out dissent, they implicitly assent.

When freedom is gone, it's because people forgot what freedom is.
