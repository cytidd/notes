A learning culture is not enough. Need a learning system. What behaviors do we want? Encourage these. Deliberate practice.

"It's time to bury Caeser."

Start with the mistake. Don't bury it.

Selling a bunch of products?
| Do more of | Do less of |
| ------ | ------ |
|Most profitable|Least profitable|
|ERP/Automated|BRP/Bespoke|
|Fastest|Slowest|

Automate RUNI work (Recurring Urgent Non-Important). Move beyond just _doing_ work, into studying your work and how to make it better and easier over time.

The grunt work an AI will do is often work that a person needs to do to learn how to do their job more efficiently, especially for BRP or even ERP-type jobs. How to replicate the "in the trenches" learning once an AI is doing it? Can we even do that? Will the meaning of "I'm a lawyer" change, since they won't have the benefit of the "in the trenches" learning anymore?

The price we pay for things will change - the prices themselves will be tailored for the consumer, their circumstances, their budget. No longer is the Internet the great equalizer, bringing the lowest prices on a big list. Prices change in seconds.  When the Internet is your salesman, you can afford to bring back haggling.

Beware of surface effects. Bodybuilder vs gymnast. Which one would you want to swim a long distance to save you?

Don't forget about complexity and only see what's on the surface.

Information Asymmetry. What's in the negative space?

- Grades vs Learning - grades are shallow.
- Money vs Value - judge people by a simple metric
- Instagram vs Life - only the "best" moments

Bullshit Filters = Skin in the game, seller's motivations

Heroes on pedestals are rarely challenged by the people who put them there.

Gould: "The stereotype of a fully rational and objective scientific method, with individual scientists as logical (and interchangeable with) robots, is self-serving mythology."

Scientific discovery only looks clean, cold and rational after it's done.

Seneca: "The reason it is so difficult to return to health (reason) is that we do not realize we are sick."

*Galilean Relativity*
- Consider your perspective in relation to results. Are we really achieving what we think we are?
- we don't notice the planet move because we are moving at the same velocity.
- on a ship, drop a ball. Only the fish sees the x-axis.
- make sure we don't miss a frame of reference

If obesity has such a negative effect on so many bodily systems, why do we think the brain would be spared?

Drucker: "Follow effective action with quiet reflection. From the quiet reflection, will come even more effective action."

Be customer-focused and you will never run out of forces to drive innovation, because people don't know how to be satisfied.

Beware of process by proxy. Ensure you're not measuring the process - always the result.

Codify business goals, to embed them in the employees' brains.
