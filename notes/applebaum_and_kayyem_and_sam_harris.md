### Transcribed Notes

Trump's media flip flops are the same as dictatorial governments.

He is the epitome of Gershwin's Law.

People tune out because they can't keep up with it all. That's the desired effect - make the pigs and idiots tune out.

Happens in authoritative governments - people can't deal with it.

Trump likes Putin. He likes a person who has journalists killed.

There is no American tradition of admiring autocracies.

Impeachment is political. Only if Republicans think he's a political liability.

Internet has created tribes, where community isn't physical. Idiots #1 writ large.

Trump appeals to people because it's entertainment. Never have to worry about their own lives - being distracted is a national pastime.

Anyone who wants Trump impeached is hoping for President Pence.

Good Republicans are doing Republicans no favors.

Nobody's quitting because "who's next"?

Trump doesn't appreciate how hard it is to defend the country.  Colossal unprofessionalism. Runs the risk of getting people killed or start wars.

Trump handed the Deep State the reason to withhold information from the President.

Paul Ryan is responsible for Trump.

In France, it's country before party.
In America, it's party before country.
