## Persuasion

*Will you do as I want?*
1. Reciprocity - I'd be returning a favor, so sure
2. Consistency - I've done this before, or it gels with my sense of self, so sure
3. Social Proof - others are doing it, so sure
4. Liking - I like you, so sure
5. Authority - you seem like an expert, so sure
6. Scarcity - I'm going to miss out, so sure


As soon as I think, or start thinking, that something is true or may be true, I am automatically reinforcing my positive bias about that thing, and making it harder to dislodge it.  It becomes harder to convince me otherwise.

My thinking something is true can be influenced by outside forces. Clouds in the background = comfort.

"Do you consider yourself an adventurous person?" Get people to connect to to the side of themselves you need to manipulate/persuade, before attempting to get them to part with their money. Priming the pump.

Selling? Move from no to yes first. Be the first one, every time.  Make a concession first. Plan to make it from the start. Reciprocity.
