### Transcribed Notes

Trump's goal seems to be to diminish US stature

No arguments about arguments, it's infinite regress

Russians don't have conversations in ways that they _believe_ to be secret, so every time the US releases info about Trump/Russia, we are revealing something to the Russians - which is a real loss.

Frum says courts are overstepping.

NATO countries blurred their global and national politics. Trump is dismantling that. Governing by intents, not values.

Don't get ahead of the story

People expect bigger news than they get.

Kushner is not the guy to talk about military matters.  He's also the last guy in the world you'd want as a back channel.

We live in a place of secrets, but no mysteries.

We're criminalizing politics.

People are shifting from country is #1, to party is #1

The lesson of Trump is that we need higher standards of decency. Because he's so appalling, we must be _more_ decent.

a byline with one source cannot be taken seriously

In America, if you try to bribe a police officer, you are likely to end up in jail. Not true for the most of the rest of the world.

Defending against corruption is paramount.

Erosion of ethics is huge danger.

Trump is _not_ a deal-maker. It's an illusion.

The silver lining is the civic engagement.
