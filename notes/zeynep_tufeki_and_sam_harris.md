### Transcribed Notes

"Surveillance Capitalism"

Enormous amount of brainpower going into getting us to pay attention, consume online, click on ads, imagining ourselves owning/wearing/experiencing digital and physical goods.

Huge infrastructure involved in making us do these things.

Indirect invasion of privacy via probabilistic interpretation of vast amounts of data 

perfect for authoritarians

can be used to determine how best to scare people, guide them into a desired path or reaction.

the Internet gives the illusion of openness, but is facilitating more closed, walled gardens of thought and opinon. Tribes.

more information = more ways to feed our confirmation bias

compares Facebook/Twitter/social medial to salt licks.

Facebook is showing people what they like to see, and will obscure posts that do not fit a person's world view, even from people in a user's friend list.

Reinforcing the silos. Machine learning side effects.

The true danger is no strong cultural ethos about misinformation.

Ted Cruz's data people ended up being Trump's data people. They tried to use people's Facebook likes to figure out their psychological profiles. Yes, that shit is public. They can fairly accurately guess sexual orientation, place of the Big 5 of psychology: (extroversion, neuroticism, etc), are you religious (and which one), whether the user specifically publicizes this or not - all from the user's public posts.

This allows a group to tailor their message to the individual, and not the group. Different messaging depending on the user's profile. No longer is a TV ad that shows to a broad audience, both the intended targets AND the opposition.  Now it's a single message to a single person that the opposition will never see or be given an opportunity to counter.

Trump campaign tried to demotivate people from voting.

Machine learning can do in seconds what it takes thousands of humans hundreds or thousands of hours.

Social media tells advertisers that it's a great platform for persuading people, and tells its users that it's not, really.  Right.

Children do not have ways to determine credibility. Should have a safe, ad-free area.  Good luck with that.

"Computational inference system" (CIS) - can detect manic episodes in bipolar patients from their tweets and posts (public ones), before they even clinically manifest. Such people are more compulsive, can be persuaded more easily. Great time to market to them that trip to Vegas.

CIS are black boxes.

Can use social media to figure out when people are vulnerable to suggestion.

Press is stuck on the page-view model.

Press is using the ad model. They're salt licks.

Trump manipulated this "chase the page" to dominate.

Algorithms are pushing people to the edge of ideas, to the edges of extremism, because that continues to keep them engaged.

Going to the center satisfies people, they grow sated, and look away.

Online self-radicalization.

The algorithms are inviting more and more radical persuaders into the meeting.

Non-partisan bias, magnification of your own bias

Wikileaks has become un-curated. They're just publishing whatever they're fed. Destructive.

So many connected systems are talking to each other now - how many are black boxes? How many are doing this with no human intervention?

Wikileaks is illegitimate, targeting specific groups.

Methods that should be shunned, are instead gleefully used by mass media.

Trust Me I'm Lying confirmation.

Why does Windows 10 advertise at me?

Mirai botnet

Companies are not incentivized to fix their IoT holes. We should hold companies accountable for releasing products with defective security. Time to change the as-is aspect of software. In other countries, if an engineer builds a bad bridge and it collapses, they can be held personally accountable.

Update software as often as you can.

Secure primary email

Gmail security key

Don't reuse password

Anti-virus is snake oil

Be on a device that keeps you safe.
