## Note Card Thoughts
Earlier this year I started writing down thoughts that struck me on 3x5 note cards. I like to flip through them. Here they are, so you can flip through them, too. It's also a pretty good way to see what I've been reading.

Soundbites are surface knowledge. Topsoil. Easily blown away.||
Not only do we need to filter, we need to be aware of what filters our information has already been through.||
Explain one instance of clickbait that changed your life. I'll wait.||
Clickbait is digital heroin. ||
Of all a person's resources, time is the one thing inexorably diminishing. If only wasting time was seen as bad as wasting money.||
50 years ago, anybody could be "smart". Today, if you're wealthy, it's assumed that you're "smart". If you're poor, it's assumed that you are "dumb." Intelligence predicates status.||

AI may be about to hit a J-curve, and accelerate the destructive impact on the job market as we know it.  Or, it isn't. The future is hard.||
High IQ is luck. Smarts are not earned. It's a gift.||
Clinton's "deplorables comment change the history of the world by peeling off the veil of the contempt for the uneducated."|Charles Murray|
SAT was an effective brain drain from the hinterlands over generations. ||
Intelligence is hereditary, and is stronger the older the parent.||
"We are doing enormous harm to young people by making it harder to treat them as individuals."|Charles Murray|
For how many people is their #1 focus in their job to appear busy? How are they incentivized to have ideas if their environment is basically telling them that their ideas are worthless? How much is lost by suppressing the best-positioned idea generators?||

"Know how songs get stuck in your head? Same thing happens with thoughts. Be careful."|Naval Ravikant|
"The probability of loss is no more measurable than the probability of rain."|Howard Marks|
Cause and effect chains have a hard time with the random chance element. It's never A+B=C. It's A+B+a whole alphabet=C||
High probabilities are likely lower than we think. More probable, sure, but not by all that much.||

Don't let users specify answers. They don't know what the actual problem is.||
Features are not objectives. They are results, and they may not completely solve the problem. Avoiding problems != solving problems.||

Manage your environment or it will manage you.||
For a company, community, or country to come together, it needs a common goal or foe. Preferably a foe.||
Don't automate black boxes.||

"The intuitive mind is a sacred gift, and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift."|Albert Einstein|
Don't forget to think about what might be hiding in the negative space.||
"Give me a list of pros and cons." All that does is show the risks, but not the uncertainty. This does not lend itself to allow for heuristics.||
Risk + Uncertainty = adaptive toolbox. Know what heuristic to use in which environment. Can be a combination.||
You are dealing with risk when you know the alternatives. You are dealing with uncertainty when you don't know all the alternatives, outcomes, or their probabilities.||
There are no traffic jams on the extra mile.||
Like a sand castle collapses into a wave of individual grains, so does wealth into poverty. It is the Second Law of Thermodynamics.||
Poverty is humanity's natural state, yet incredible amounts of energy is expended trying to decide who's to blame for it.||
If a system's natural tendency is to break down, then that means staying in a working state is improbable. Order is improbable, without intervention.||

The first step in learning from failure is to avoid treating one like a disaster. A meteor smacking into a city is a disaster. Dinosaurs running amok is a disaster. Lava flowing through the hallways is a disaster.  If nobody was injured, then it's probably not a disaster.||
"Plans are useless, but planning is indispensable."|Dwight Eisenhower|
Be suspicious of anyone who claims to have a grand plan. They probably have a 5 or 10 year plan they'd like to show you.||
Multi-year plans are okay if they're specific. "Release product x." Not "be a leader in market segment Y."||
"You must study the endgame before everything else."|Grandmaster Jose Raul Capablanca|
If your product requires help from marketing or salespeople to convince people of its worth, then it's not good enough.||
Out of all avenues attempted in problem solving, the innovation is the thing that worked. I'd rather be labelled a "creative thinker" than an innovative one, because the latter implies that I come up with working solutions all of the time.||
Gorillas are the market leaders. Chimps promote different product approach to the same customers. Monkeys attempt to clone gorillas at a lower price and exaggerated performance claims.||
Delighting the customer always yields better results than countering or copying a competitor. It's just a lot harder to do.||
To determine if future self would want to do something, ask present self if you'd like to do it right now. If the answer is not "Hell, yes!" then the proper response is "Hell, no!"||
"What if" yourself to death = living in delusions of the future at the expense of the present.||
"Most of the time, we're dreaming at ourselves."|Naval Ravikant|
Be suspicious of your beliefs if they form neat packages. Some of them were likely wrapped by somebody else.||
The reliability of the total system is less than that of the least reliable component.||
Technology reliability x human reliability = system reliability. TR x HR = SR.||
Rejecting risk instead makes life riskier.||
"Arbitrary" means different things. In science, it is a non-negative decision to get on with the work. In social activism, it is derived from mere opinion; capricious; not limited by law; absolute, despotic.||
We get what we reward for.||
I read to learn from the mistakes and triumphs of others. Doing it all by myself seems terribly inefficient.||
System 1 uses the Interpreter. System 2's job (part of it) is to fact-check the Interpreter. It needs time to do that, though.||
Favor something? Work through the impact of implementing it. Anything different?||
Disagree with an effect? Determine the intent of the implementation. Anything different?||
If a mob relies on baseless opinion, it is confirmation bias writ large.||
The division of cognitive labor is useful for things like flush toilets, combustion engines, and air-conditioning. It is less useful on decisions that require deep understanding - political, economic, things that affect large groups.||
When learning something new, always understand the motivations of the information's author.||
7 characteristics of highly-resilient people: optimism, decisive action, honesty, tenacity, interpersonal connectedness, self-control, calmly innovative, non-dogmatic thinking.||
Long-term plans take on a life of their own and don't map to reality. We're more apt to hang on because to change it would be the same as admitting we're wrong.||
Someone in your company keeps trying to make 5-10 year plans? FIRE THEM IMMEDIATELY.||
If you're going to throw things at the wall to see what sticks (this is inefficient), at least make sure the variables don't conflict with each other.||
Doing what everyone else does and banking on different results means on is counting on black/white swans. Seems inefficient.||
Surface knowledge is just that: superficial. Cheap. It's what everyone else has got. So, by definition, average.||
Engineering breakpoints: blow a fuse instead of catching the house on fire.||
Beware contrast mis-reaction - compare apples to themselves.||
Get the incentives right.||
Only 20% of people can be in the top fifth.||

Technology cost-savings isn't going to move the needle much if that tech is available to all of your competitors.||
Avoid people and places that punish new ideas.||
Bad attitudes is because of bad leadership. Shitty employee attitudes is not indicative of bad employees, bad working environments, or even bad customers. It's indicative of shitty leadership.||
A Dunkin Donuts will probably not go out of business. You'd almost have to try to kill it.  Even then, it would fight you.||
A person who blows up when learning about negative things will eventually only be told about positive things. This is not good if that person is in charge, because then their reality will be false.||
Learn to recognize antipathy upon hearing things I don't like, and to look past that antipathy.||
Companies: be #1 or #2 or out.||
The Five W's: Tell who to do what, when, where, and why.||
A few mistakes in 100 small decisions is better than one mistake when you're making few, big decisions.||
Setbacks are teachable moments.||
Acquiring wisdom is a moral duty.||
Be reliable. Unreliability can cancel out the other virtues.||
Avoid intense ideologies. Remember the Scandanavian Canoeists. Avoid big whirlpools.|Charlie Munger|
Get rid of envy, resentment, self-pity, and self-serving bias. They do not help.||
"Unless you're going to do a 100%, 24/7, wholesale swap with someone else, there's no use in being jealous of them."|Naval Ravikant|
Sit down and do it until it is done.|Neil Gaiman|
Reverse a challenge: state the challenge, list the assumptions, challenge each one, reverse each assumption, record differing viewpoints, how to accomplish each reversal?||
Just because someone asks for a knob, doesn't mean there has to be a door.  It might be better to leave the door - and the knob - out completely.|Thinkertoys|
Be suspicious of the measuring stick.|Thinkertoys|
Don't stop at the first answer. Stop when you cannot think of any more answers.|Thinkertoys|
A new idea is the same thing everyone else is looking at, just in a new pattern.|Thinkertoys|
If you don't know how it will be used, then you don't know how to build it.||
What is the end state? Who will use it in this state? In what way will they enjoy using it? What would frustrate them about it? = problem framing||
Don't be a Duke of Habit.|Thinkertoys|
Solve problems backwards. Visualize the end state, and then identify blockers. Ensure you are not one of them. If you cannot get out of your own way, it won't matter if you fix everything else. You'll still fail.||
Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance.|Charlie Munger (and others)|
Reducing stressors actually enhances fragility.||
Hofstatder's Law: It will always take longer than you think, even after taking Hofstatder's Law into account.||
Hanlon's Razor: That which can be attributed to malice might instead be attributed to stupidity.||
Hitchens' Razor: That which is asserted without evidence, may be dismissed without evidence.|Christopher Hitchens|
The brain is a collection of grouped systems that perform specific functions. There is no I. Might be a "we", though.||
The unified mind merges from the thousands of lower-level processes operating in parallel.||
A thing happens, we react, we feel something about it, and then we go on explaining it. That's the Interpreter. It will create context where there is none, fabricating a fiction all day long before ever admitting "I don't know."||
The Interpreter does not perform any data validation. Garbage in? Garbage out.||
Success isn't found. It's engineered.||
When a unit of measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a useful unit of measure.||
"If one takes away riches from a wise man, one leaves him still in possession of all that is his..."|Seneca|
Importance != urgency. Remember the Eisenhower matrix.||
Practice deliberately. Not knowing the goal reduces the ability to deliver. Focused attention, immediate feedback, rest. Focus is required for increased intensity, rest allows for insights from focus work.||
Thinking means concentrating on something long enough to develop an idea about it.||
Attention residue after switching tasks increases drag.|Sophie Leroy|
"A little learning is a dangerous thing." Quick reads do not impart understanding. If everyone spend the same five minutes to understand something, everyone has the same shitty understanding.||
It's easier to observe change on the micro level than the macro.||
"Nobody reaches enlightenment or internal happiness or does serious internal work in group settings."|Naval Ravikant|
"Happiness is a single-player game."|The Happy Philosopher|
"The advantage of meditation is not that you're going to suddenly gain the superpower to control your internal state, it's that you will recognize just how out of control your mind is."|Naval Ravikant|
My core values: #1: Honesty. #2: Anger is useless. Go be angry at someone else somewhere else. #3: Don't go looking for stress. #4: Find what brings me joy, and do that.||
If the mind is a muscle, I should be careful about what activity I'm training it to do.||
If I have an algorithm that predicts how people will respond to something I might say, how will that affect my speech, thoughts, priorities? What unintended consequences will happen because of such a thing?||
Reading Facebook to gain deep understanding is like plunging your head into a pail of diarrhea. There are more efficient methods to filter truth from shit.||
I saw "fake news crisis" in an article today. Could be replaces instead with "foundational knowledge crisis."||
Just because X is similar to Y, the occurrence of X does not increase the probability of Y.||
Be aware of what you're trained to see.||
"Wherever there is uncertainty, there is judgement, and wherever there is judgement there is an opportunity for human fallibility."|Redelmeir|
Does insurance increase the likelihood of an insured event occurring?||
The theory of Marxism depends on the assumption that human envy does not exist.||
Beware the tyranny of the job description.||
"Meeting the requirements is easier than doing the job right."|Garrett Hardin|
When a topic is taboo, or considered "settled" and viewed off-limits, it affords someone with questions no alternatives but to seek out those who will talk about it - and those who will speak about it usually hold the minority view.||
The "everything is connected to everything else" is nose/wedge/slope in disguise - ecolate in fashion but not numerate. Invalid when taken to extremes.||
Our actions indicate we are willing to take risks, and thereby invalidate the nose/wedge/slope laws or ideas.||
"We can never do merely one thing."|Garrett Hardin|
What parts of a problem are causes, which are symptoms, which are related, which are unrelated, which are roots, which are blockers, which are systemic, which are patterns.||
Post-mortems: If I had time to properly analyze results and find ways to get better, I would actually BE better.||
Those pictures that have blurbs that tell me how to think about them: how long does it take for me to disagree with the words? How much is downloaded and imprinted before that happens?||
Forming an opinion? Understand how your own cognitive bias might be leading you astray.||
"...the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already..."|Leo Tolstoy|
Envisioning failure doesn't mean that you must recognize failure as an acceptable outcome. Knowing what failure looks like is almost as important as knowing what success looks like.  The path to both is littered with signposts and can signal when it's time to stay the course, and when it's time for a course correction.||
